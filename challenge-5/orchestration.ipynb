    "# üìã Multi-Agent Insurance Claim Orchestration\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "The `orchestration.ipynb` notebook implements a **sophisticated multi-agent orchestration system** for insurance claim processing using **Microsoft Semantic Kernel** and **Azure AI Agent Service**. This notebook demonstrates advanced concurrent agent coordination to analyze insurance claims from multiple specialized perspectives simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "## üèóÔ∏è Architecture & Components\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core Technologies\n",
    "- **Microsoft Semantic Kernel**: Agent orchestration framework\n",
    "- **Azure AI Agent Service**: Cloud-based agent hosting and management\n",
    "- **Concurrent Orchestration**: Parallel execution of multiple AI agents\n",
    "- **Azure Cosmos DB Integration**: Real-time data access through custom plugins\n",
    "- **Azure Identity**: Secure authentication for Azure services\n",
    "\n",
    "### Agent Specializations\n",
    "The system creates three specialized AI agents that work concurrently:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **üîç Claim Reviewer Agent**\n",
    "   - Validates claim documentation completeness\n",
    "   - Analyzes damage assessments and cost estimates\n",
    "   - Identifies inconsistencies or missing information\n",
    "   - Provides VALID/QUESTIONABLE/INVALID determinations\n",
    "   - Equipped with Cosmos DB plugin for data retrieval\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **‚ö†Ô∏è Risk Analyzer Agent**\n",
    "   - Detects fraud patterns and suspicious indicators\n",
    "   - Assesses claim authenticity and credibility\n",
    "   - Analyzes timing, amounts, and circumstances\n",
    "   - Provides LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH risk assessments\n",
    "   - Equipped with Cosmos DB plugin for historical analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **üìã Policy Checker Agent**\n",
    "   - Validates coverage against policy terms\n",
    "   - Interprets limits, deductibles, and exclusions\n",
    "   - Handles multiple policy types (Auto, Commercial, Motorcycle, etc.)\n",
    "   - Provides COVERED/NOT COVERED/PARTIAL COVERAGE determinations\n",
    "   - Uses Azure AI Search for policy document analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "## üîß Key Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "### `create_specialized_agents()`\n",
    "- Establishes Azure AI Agent client connections\n",
    "- Configures each agent with specialized instructions and capabilities\n",
    "- Sets up Cosmos DB plugins for data-enabled agents\n",
    "- Configures polling options for optimal performance\n",
    "- Returns a collection of ready-to-use specialized agents\n",
    "\n",
    "### `run_insurance_claim_orchestration()`\n",
    "- **Concurrent Processing**: All three agents analyze claims simultaneously\n",
    "- **Intelligent Task Distribution**: Each agent receives specialized instructions\n",
    "- **Real-time Data Access**: Agents can retrieve claim data using provided claim IDs\n",
    "- **Comprehensive Reporting**: Generates unified analysis reports combining all agent outputs\n",
    "- **Error Handling**: Robust exception management and resource cleanup\n",
    "- **Progress Tracking**: Detailed logging of orchestration stages\n",
    "\n",
    "## üöÄ Orchestration Flow\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Agent Creation**: Initializes three specialized insurance processing agents\n",
    "2. **Concurrent Orchestration Setup**: Creates parallel execution framework\n",
    "3. **Task Distribution**: Assigns specialized analysis tasks to each agent\n",
    "4. **Parallel Execution**: All agents work simultaneously on their respective analyses\n",
    "5. **Result Aggregation**: Collects and consolidates outputs from all agents\n",
    "6. **Report Generation**: Creates comprehensive analysis report with all findings\n",
    "7. **Resource Cleanup**: Properly terminates runtime and releases resources\n",
    "\n",
    "## üìä Output Format\n",
    "\n",
    "The system generates a comprehensive **Insurance Claim Analysis Report** that includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Individual Agent Assessments**: Detailed analysis from each specialized perspective\n",
    "- **Claim Validity Status**: Complete documentation and accuracy assessment\n",
    "- **Risk Profile Analysis**: Fraud indicators and authenticity evaluation\n",
    "- **Policy Coverage Determination**: Coverage eligibility and terms validation\n",
    "- **Unified Recommendations**: Consolidated next steps based on all agent analyses\n",
    "\n",
    "## üí° Advanced Features\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Concurrent Execution**: True parallelism for faster processing\n",
    "- **Database Integration**: Real-time access to claim and policy data\n",
    "- **Flexible Configuration**: Environment-based model and endpoint configuration\n",
    "- **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed progress tracking and status updates\n",
    "- **Timeout Management**: 5-minute timeout for orchestration completion\n",
    "- **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of individual agent failures\n",
    "\n",
    "## üéØ Use Case Example\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook includes a practical example demonstrating the orchestration of claim analysis for \"CL002\", showing how the system processes claim details and retrieves additional data to provide comprehensive multi-agent analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "This implementation represents a cutting-edge approach to insurance claim processing, leveraging the power of concurrent AI agents to provide thorough, multi-perspective analysis that would traditionally require multiple human experts working in sequence.\n"

      "- Claim Details: The incident occurred on July 17, 2025 at 8:30 AM at a parking lot in Springfield, OH. The vehicle involved is a 2004 Silver Honda Accord. The claimant's description of the incident is consistent with the location and timing reported.\n",
      "- Damage Description: The claim details extensive damage to the front bumper, driver‚Äôs side quarter panel, wheel, door, headlamp, and possible hidden mechanical damage. Photo evidence corroborates significant front left side damage including body panel crumpling, bumper detachment, wheel misalignment, and headlamp damage.\n",
      "- Documentation: The claim includes witness information, police report from Springfield Police Dept., and an estimate from Springfield Auto Body repair shop. These documents provide sufficient support and credible evidence for the claim.\n",
      "- Damage and Cost Assessment: The described damage and repair needs appear reasonable and consistent with the accident mechanism. The presence of a spare tire and the detailed damage in photos align with the claim estimate for both cosmetic and mechanical repairs.\n",
      "- Completeness: The claim is well-supported by signed statements, witness contact details, and official police report number, enhancing its credibility and completeness.\n",
      "- Policy Cross-Reference: No matching policy documents were found in the search for policy number LIAB-AUTO-001; however, the claim falls under a liability auto policy type, typically covering such damage sustained. Confirmation of coverage specifics is recommended from policy documents.\n",
      "\n",
      "Any Missing Info / Concerns:\n",
      "- Policy Document: The actual policy document LIAB-AUTO-001 was not found for review to precisely confirm coverage limits, deductibles, or exclusions.\n",
      "- Repair Cost Estimate Details: While the repair shop estimate is included, detailed cost breakdowns would strengthen the assessment.\n",
      "- Verification of Other Party‚Äôs Insurance: It could be relevant to verify the other party‚Äôs insurance details as involved in the accident.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next Steps:\n",
      "- Obtain and review the specific policy document LIAB-AUTO-001 to confirm coverage terms including any relevant deductibles or exclusions.\n",
      "- Request a detailed repair cost breakdown from the repair shop to verify reasonableness against industry standards.\n",
      "- Confirm third-party insurance details to coordinate liability and possible subrogation.\n",
      "- Proceed with vehicle assessment and approve repair authorization pending policy coverage confirmation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary: The claim appears valid based on detailed evidence and documentation. Proper verification of the missing policy document and cost details is recommended prior to final approval.\n",
